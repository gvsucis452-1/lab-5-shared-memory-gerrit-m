in regards to the reader and writer:

If you only have one instance of the reader open, the reader will recieve the message twice.
If you do not have the reader open, the writer endlessly waits for responses, and will not prompt again.
In the above case, you will still be able to type.
If both readers are running, behavior works as expected.
All instances must be closed separately, closing the writer will not close the readers automatically(?) have not tested to be fair.
